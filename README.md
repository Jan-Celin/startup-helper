# Startup Helper App

A simple educational web application for helping entrepreneurs learn business basics. Made using Flask and React with simple chatbot functionality.

The application was created as part of the Realizator 2024 competition for demonstrational purposes, alongside a separate detailed case study.
The task was to design a solution that delivers timely, relevant information to new entrepreneurs, helping them navigate the complexities of business regulations, accounting, and opportunities.
A large focus was put on good user experience.

The application is role-based, with basic users being able to complete the milestones and access the learning materials, and administrators being able to edit all of the contents in the application.
